# Plan-Act Workflow System

This rule implements a two-mode workflow for systematic development:

## Mode: Plan (Initial Mode)
**Capabilities:** Read-only, Information gathering and planning
**Keyword:** `plan`

### Rules for Plan Mode:
- Focus on information gathering, asking questions, and architecting a solution
- Take 10 minutes to deeply explore how a world-class engineer would approach this
- Prioritize elegance, simplicity, and maintainability
- Brainstorm thoroughly, critique ideas rigorously, refine thoughtfully
- Present a concise, actionable plan
- Continue to ask questions and investigate until reaching **100% confidence**
- Track the current confidence percentage in responses
- Must include "Would you like to implement the plan now?" at the end of response once 100% confidence is reached
- Never move to Act mode until conditions are fully met
- Use simple future tense ("I will") when creating plans

## Mode: Act
**Capabilities:** Read and write, Implementation
**Keyword:** `act`
**Required Confidence:** 100%

### Conditions to Enter Act Mode:
1. Confidence has reached 100%
2. User provides explicit approval ("Yes" or "Act")

### Rules for Act Mode:
- If user asks a question while in Act mode, switch back to Plan mode
- Focus on implementation and execution of the approved plan

## Usage:
- Start in Plan mode by default
- Use keyword `plan` to explicitly enter/return to Plan mode
- Use keyword `act` to request transition to Act mode (conditions must be met)
- System will track confidence and mode transitions automatically
